# Python Live Project
After completing the Python course, I participated in a two-week sprint. I was tasked with using Python within the Django framework to create a dynamic web application. I chose cartoons as my topic and built a destinations website that allows a user to create, review, update, and delete information about their favorite cartoon series. I used several functions in the views in order to retrieve data and display them on the applicable HTML template. Additionally, I connected an API and wrote a basic JSON response, which allows the user to search any word in the Oxford Dictionary and view its definition. I also used the Python library Beautiful Soup to scrape/parse data from other sites to display on my site.

## Creating the Basic App
To start, I created a new application within the Django framework using PyCharm as my IDE. I created the base and home templates and then added functions to the views in order for a homepage with a navbar to render. I then registered my URLs and linked my application to the main project homepage. Most of the styling and layout for this web application was done using Bootstrap 4 with some modifications. I also added some basic animations using CSS and JavaScript.

## Creating the Model and Form
I created an object model class with a manager and defined its attributes.

models.py:
```cs
    Genre_Choices = (
        ('comedy','Comedy'),
        ('anime', 'Anime'),
        ('horror','Horror'),
        ('sitcom', 'Sitcom'),
        ('musical', 'Musical'),
        ('kids', 'Kids'),
        ('slice of life','Slice of LIfe'),
        ('early animation','Early Animation'),
    )

    class Cartoon(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        genre = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=Genre_Choices, default='Comedy')
        network = models.CharField(max_length=30)
        premier_date = models.DateField()
        brief_description = models.TextField(max_length=1000, default="")

        Cartoons = models.Manager()

        def __str__(self):
            return self.title
```
Next, I created a model form that includes any inputs the user needs to make. 

forms.py:
```cs
    from django import forms
    from .models import Cartoon

    # creating our modelform
    class CartoonForm(forms.ModelForm):
        class Meta:
            model = Cartoon
            fields = "__all__"
```
I then made a template page for the form, as well as a view function that renders all cartoons in the database. This page only displays the title and premiere date of the cartoon in the database, so I created another view function that allows users to click on a cartoon's title, bringing them to another template that displays the additional details of that cartoon.

views.py:
```cs
    def DisplayCartoons(request):
        cartoon_list = Cartoon.Cartoons.all().order_by("premier_date")
        context = {'cartoon_list': cartoon_list}
        return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_list.html', context)
```
```cs
    def DisplayDetails(request, pk):
        item = get_object_or_404(Cartoon, pk=pk)
        context = {'item': item}
        return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_details.html', context)
```
![List Details](/GIFs/ListDetails.gif)

## CRUD Functionality
This view function saves the details of the cartoon to the database that the user inputs into the form.
```cs
    def CreateCartoon(request):
        form = CartoonForm(data=request.POST or None)
        if request.method=='POST':
            if form.is_valid():
                form.save()
                return redirect('Cartoons_home')
        context = {'form': form}
        return render(request, "Cartoons/Cartoons_create.html", context)
```
This view function allows the user to edit/update a cartoon's details.
```cs
    def UpdateItem(request, pk):
        item = Cartoon.Cartoons.get(pk=pk)
        form = CartoonForm(request.POST or None, instance=item)

        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('Cartoons_list')

        context = {'item': item, 'form': form}
        return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_up_date.html', context)
```
This view function enables a user to delete cartoons from the database.
```cs
    def DeleteItem(request, pk):
        context = {}
        item = get_object_or_404(Cartoon, pk=pk)

        if request.method == "POST":
            item.delete()
            return redirect("Cartoons_list")

        return render(request, "Cartoons/Cartoons_delete.html", context)
```
![Create Update Delete](/GIFs/CreateUpdateDelete.gif)

## Connect to API
After creating a new API template, I rendered it with a view function. I then researched API documentation in order to connect the API and write a basic JSON response that allows users to search a word in the Oxford Dictionary and view its definition. I included additional functionality that saves each word and definition that was searched into a database. Next, I created a new template for displaying the previously searched words/definitions. As an extra feature, I added an input in the navbar that allows users to utilize the dictionary API. After entering a word and clicking search, they are redirected to the API template where the word that was searched and its corresponding definition are displayed.

views.py:
```cs
    def OxfordAPI(request):
        # set up api connection
        app_id='591386c7'
        app_key='ea768fd0e3d3a96ec8b39d08533c1f36'
        language='en-us'
        fields ='definitions'
        strictMatch ='false'
        # create empty list
        definition=[]
        if request.method=='POST':
            value=request.POST['word_id'].lower()
            # if input is blank it will display this message
            if value=="":
                messages.info(request, 'Please enter a search term')
            else:
                url ='https://od-api.oxforddictionaries.com:443/api/v2/entries/' + language + '/' + value + '?fields=' + fields + '&strictMatch=' + strictMatch;
                info=requests.get(url,headers={'app_id':app_id, 'app_key':app_key})
                oxford_info=info.json()
                result=oxford_info['results'][0]['lexicalEntries'][0]['entries'][0]['senses'][0]['definitions'][0]
                definition.append(result)

                save_definition = Definition.Definitions.create(
                    value=value,
                    definition=definition
                )
                save_definition.save()

            context={'value':value,'definition':definition}
            # if input is not blank then it will return the context
            return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_api.html', context)
        else:
            return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_api.html')
```
![Dictionary](/Images/Dictionary.png)

I then created a new object model class with a manager to our models.py for saving words/definitions.

models.py:
```cs
    class Definition(models.Model):
        value = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        definition = models.TextField(max_length=100)

        Definitions = models.Manager()

        def __str__(self):
            return self.value
```
Finally, I added a view function for rendering all the words/definitions in the database.

views.py:
```cs
    def DisplayDefinitions(request):
        definition_list = Definition.Definitions.all().order_by("value")
        context = {'definition_list': definition_list}
        return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_definitions.html', context)
```

![Definitions](/Images/Definitions.png)

## Beautiful Soup
Using the Python package Beautiful Soup, I parsed data from two websites to display a top ten animated series list and a top 100 animated movies list on two newly created templates that can be accessed from both the navbar and homepage.

The following code scrapes the number and titles of the cartoons from Indiewire???s website where they have ranked the best animated series of all time. There are over 60 cartoons on the list and about ten are displayed per page, so I selected the specific page that named the top ten cartoons. The titles are all under "h3" tags in the HTML code.

views.py:
```cs
    def CartoonScrape(request):
        # Create empty list.
        top_cartoons = []
        # Set up BeautifulSoup.
        source = requests.get("https://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-animated-series-all-time-cartoons-anime-tv-1202021835/5/")
        bs = BeautifulSoup(source.content, 'html.parser')
        # Get all the h3 tags under the div 'entry-content' from source site.
        rankings = bs.find('div', class_='entry-content')
        rank = rankings.find_all('h3')
        # For loop through the h3 tags but in reverse order (because they are displayed reversed on the source page).
        for h3 in reversed(rank):
            titles = h3.text
            top_cartoons.append(titles)
        # Delete indexes 8-9 which are irrelevant h3 tags.
        del top_cartoons[8:10]

        context = {'top_cartoons': top_cartoons}
        return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_rankings.html', context)
```
![Cartoon Rankings](/Images/Rankings_Cartoons.png)

Furthermore, the code below scrapes the ranking/rating/titles of the top 100 animated movies on the Rotten Tomatoes website.

views.py:
```cs
    def MovieScrape(request):
        # Create empty list.
        top_movies = []
        # Set up BeautifulSoup.
        source = requests.get("https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/top_100_animation_movies/")
        bs = BeautifulSoup(source.content, 'html.parser')
        # Get all the "a" tags under the table 'table' from source site.
        rankings = bs.find('table', class_='table')
        rank = rankings.find_all('tr')
        # For loop that iterates through all the "a" tags.
        for tr in rank:
            titles = tr.text
            top_movies.append(titles)
        # Delete index 0, which is not needed.
        del top_movies[0]

        context = {'top_movies': top_movies}
        return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_movies.html', context)
```

## Conclusion
The Python live project provided me with my first full-scale opportunity to utilize project methodologies and gain a detailed understanding of version control. I worked with other students within an Agile framework environment on the Microsoft Azure DevOps platform. I was able to make commits, merges, and push/pulls in real-time while being aware of how to minimize merge conflicts. I participated in daily standup meetings to discuss progress and roadblocks, as well as a retrospective meeting upon completion of the app. I really enjoyed this process and look forward to utilizing everything learned from this sprint in future projects!
